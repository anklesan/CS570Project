        <h3><p><b>1 &nbsp; Introduction</b></p></h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the use and development of heterogeneous computing
            with the search to find new ways to increase efficiency. We plan to conduct a survey that collects
            information regarding heterogeneous computing in an AI context. Our project seeks to
            gather information on the different ways artificial intelligence has influenced the increase and
            development of heterogeneous computing. Alongside that, we are looking to gather information on how
            AI is being used to optimize the use of the given architecture by allowing the AI to
            take over parts of the scheduling or design. We hope to gain information regarding the different
            applications of AI in the optimization of these processes and the successes or
            failures of these implementations. We chose this topic due to the increasing relevance of heterogeneous
            computing and an increase in applications of AI in the field of computer architecture.
            Through the data collection done with the survey, this project will explore what heterogeneous computing
            is and how it relates to AI. It will explore the adoption, challenges, and benefits of
            heterogeneous computing in AI applications. The goal is to have the survey include
            information from both academic research and industry applications to gain a well-rounded understanding.
            Overall, this project hopes to collect information regarding heterogeneous computing in an AI context to
            analyze and present the information in a meaningful way.</p>
    

    <h3><b>2 &nbsp; Background</b></p></h3>
    <b>2.1 &nbsp;What is Heterogeneous Computing?</b>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heterogeneous computing is a computing architecture that incorporates multiple types of processors or cores within a single system,
         each specialized for different computational tasks. This approach leverages the strengths of various processing units—such as CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, and FPGAs—to optimize performance, 
         energy efficiency, and computational speed. By allocating tasks to the most suitable processor type, heterogeneous computing systems can handle a wide range of applications more effectively than homogeneous systems.
    </p>
    <b>2.2 &nbsp; Why is it relevant to Artificial intelligence?</b>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heterogeneous computing is relevant for AI due to its ability to enhance performance, improve energy efficiency, and provide flexibility for diverse AI workloads. 
        By leveraging various types of processors—such as CPUs for general tasks, GPUs for parallel processing, 
        and specialized accelerators for specific AI functions—heterogeneous computing systems can efficiently handle the intensive computational demands of training and deploying AI models. 
        This approach enables faster processing, reduces power consumption, and supports the scalability and innovation needed for the complex and varied applications of AI technology.</p>
    <b>2.2.1 &nbsp; AI Heuristic Search</b>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AI Heuristic search is an algorithm that uses the heuristic functions to find the best solution.</p>
    <b>2.2.2 &nbsp; Simulated Annealing</b>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p>
        </p>

    <h3><b>3 &nbsp; Related Literature</b></p></h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Memeti <i>et al.</i> [1] bring forward an approach to heterogeneous computing that utilizes AI heuristic search
            techniques in combination with the use of machine learning to optimize the use of the heterogeneous system. The authors reference the 
            Enumeration and Measurements (EnuM) technique in comparison to their own when evaluating their method which they call AI heuristics with machine 
            learning (AML). EnuM is also known as brute-force search and it evaluates every option available before making a decsion based on those results. The 
            authors aim to determine a near optimal system configuration using their proposed method. Their proposed method uses the heuristic seach as a guide 
            through the parameter space and uses simulated annealing (SA) to conduct the parameter space exploration. The authors then use decision tree regression, 
            a supervised machine learning model, to evaluate the system configuration. The results of their experiment shows that AML is more than 1300 times faster
            than EnuM. Another noted difference between the two is AML is able to achieve a similar energy efficiency to EnuM after only evaluating around 7% of the
            possible configurations while EnuM needs to evaluate all of the possible configurations to achieve that energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Greathouse <i>et al.</i> [2] take a different approach and use machine learning (ML) to predict an applications performance and
            power on a range of heterogeneous systems. The author's begin the process by creating the dataset to be used by the model by running various applications on
            different combinations of hardware and storing that data. Using a fully connected neural network with a linear input layer and sigmoid functions for the hidden
            and output layers the kernels are trained and clustered. Within the clusters the authrors set it to pick the kernel with the highest value as the representative
            for that cluster. The model is then used with an application to predict and a cluster is picked basied on which cluster the application is closest to and the scaling
            curve designed by the authors using the collected data is used to predict performance or power of the kernel depending on desired configuration. It is determined
            that the use of the designed system is very effective and does not require heavy computational effort. The authors tested the accuracy of their model and found it to have
            only 15% error rate in performance predictions and less than 10% error rate for power. </p>
    

    <h3><b>4 &nbsp; Results</b></p></h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The survey has yielded various different approaches to this topic that allow for improvement on implementations through the use
            of AI applications.

        </p>
    
    <h3><p><b>5 &nbsp; Conclusion and Future Work</b></p></h3>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the course of the term, our team seeks to accomplish a thorough survey on 
        heterogeneous computing in an artificial intelligence context. We aim to bring together a presentation of the many
        different implementations of this topic and provide an understanding on an important topic relevant in computer architecture.
        We plan to bring together a comprehensive understanding of our topic presented in a way that allows for a full understanding of
        the various approaches and possible implementations that are in progress. The result of this project should provide good insight
        into a new implementation in computer architecure in addition to the increasing use of artificial intelligence within the field.
