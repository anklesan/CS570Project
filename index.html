        <h3>Heterogeneous Computing in an AI Context</h3>


        
        <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence has increased the use and development of heterogeneous computing
            with the search to find new ways to increase efficiency. We plan to conduct a survey that collects
            information regarding heterogeneous computing in an artificial intelligence context. Our project seeks to
            gather information on the different ways artificial intelligence has influenced the increase and
            development of heterogeneous computing. Alongside that, we are looking to gather information on how
            artificial intelligence is being used to optimize the use of the given architecture by allowing the AI to
            take over parts of the scheduling or design. We hope to gain information regarding the different
            applications of artificial intelligence in the optimization of these processes and the successes or
            failures of these implementations. We chose this topic due to the increasing relevance of heterogeneous
            computing and an increase in applications of artificial intelligence in the field of computer architecture.
            Through the data collection done with the survey, this project will explore what heterogeneous computing
            is and how it relates to artificial intelligence. It will explore the adoption, challenges, and benefits of
            heterogeneous computing in artificial intelligence applications. The goal is to have the survey include
            information from both academic research and industry applications to gain a well-rounded understanding.
            Overall, this project hopes to collect information regarding heterogeneous computing in an artificial
            intelligence context to analyze and present the information in a meaningful way.</p>
