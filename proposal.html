        <p><u><b>Executive Summary</b></u></p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The advancement of artificial intelligence has increased the use and development of heterogeneous computing
            with the search to find new ways to increase efficiency. We plan to conduct a survey that collects
            information regarding heterogeneous computing in an artificial intelligence context. Our project seeks to
            gather information on the different ways artificial intelligence has influenced the increase and
            development of heterogeneous computing. Alongside that, we are looking to gather information on how
            artificial intelligence is being used to optimize the use of the given architecture by allowing the AI to
            take over parts of the scheduling or design. We hope to gain information regarding the different
            applications of artificial intelligence in the optimization of these processes and the successes or
            failures of these implementations. We chose this topic due to the increasing relevance of heterogeneous
            computing and an increase in applications of artificial intelligence in the field of computer architecture.
            Through the data collection done with the survey, this project will explore what heterogeneous computing
            is and how it relates to artificial intelligence. It will explore the adoption, challenges, and benefits of
            heterogeneous computing in artificial intelligence applications. The goal is to have the survey include
            information from both academic research and industry applications to gain a well-rounded understanding.
            Overall, this project hopes to collect information regarding heterogeneous computing in an artificial
            intelligence context to analyze and present the information in a meaningful way.</p>
    

        <b><u>Background</b></u></p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The discussion around the use of multiple cores has developed from the original
            homogeneous computing that utilizes multiple cores of the same type such as multiple GPUs or CPUs. Recently there has
            been research into the use of heterogeneous computing which takes this idea to the next level with the use of multiple
            different types of computing cores. These implementations combine the use of not only multiple CPUs or multiple GPUs but 
            the combined use of both. This allows for even more exploration into the possibility for even more efficiency.
            Alongside the exploration of heterogeneous computing is the exploration of such computing in regards to artificial intelligence.
            There are multiple discussions regarding not only the implementation of heterogeneous computing to be used for artificial intelligence
            but the implementation of artificial intelligence to desgin the heterogeneous computing.

        <b><u>Conclusion</b></u></p>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the course of the term, our team seeks to accomplish a thorough survey on 
            heterogeneous computing in an artificial intelligence context. We aim to bring together a presentation of the many
            different implementations of this topic and provide an understanding on an important topic relevant in computer architecture.
            We plan to bring together a comprehensive understanding of our topic presented in a way that allows for a full understanding of
            the various approaches and possible implementations that are in progress. The result of this project should provide good insight
            into a new implementation in computer architecure in addition to the increasing use of artificial intelligence within the field.
